# Playlist Duration Matching - Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Local Development Ready
- [x] TypeScript/JavaScript compatibility verified
- [x] Build process works without errors
- [x] Import/export statements compatible with Vite
- [x] Error handling added for robustness
- [x] Development server runs successfully

## âœ… Vercel Deployment Ready
- [x] vercel.json configured correctly for API routes
- [x] API endpoint supports increased result count (max=35)
- [x] No hardcoded localhost URLs
- [x] Proper error handling for production
- [x] ES modules compatible with Vercel

## ðŸŽµ New Features Added

### Playlist Builder (`src/lib/playlistBuilder.js`)
- Builds playlists that exactly match session duration
- Handles single long tracks (trims to fit)
- Combines multiple short tracks to fill session
- Validates input and provides fallbacks

### Queue Manager (`src/lib/queueManager.js`)
- Sequential track playback with YouTube trimming
- Automatically advances between tracks
- Stops when session timer expires
- Robust error handling

### Session Timer Integration (`src/lib/sessionTimer.js`)
- Global session state management
- Syncs with Pomodoro timer
- Provides remaining time to queue manager
- Auto-stops playlist when session ends

### Enhanced MoodPicker
- Fetches 35 tracks instead of 25 for better playlist building
- Validates playlist generation
- Improved error messages
- Better user feedback

### PlayerBar Enhancements
- Shows playlist progress (Track 2/4)
- Handles queue state changes
- Proper cleanup on session end

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
- `YT_API_KEY` or `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (already configured)

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build  # âœ… Passes
```

### Production Considerations
- YouTube IFrame API trimming via startSeconds/endSeconds
- Graceful fallback if trimming not supported
- Session timer integration prevents runaway playlists
- Error boundaries for failed API calls
- Input validation on all functions

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [x] TypeScript imports work correctly
- [x] No console errors in development
- [x] Error handling validates inputs
- [x] API endpoint handles max=35 parameter
- [x] Queue manager has proper cleanup
- [x] Session timer integration works

The playlist duration matching feature is ready for both local development and Vercel deployment!
